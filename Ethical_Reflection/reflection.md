The predictive model trained on the Breast Cancer dataset may inherit biases present in the original data. If underrepresented demographic groups (age, race, socioeconomic background) were inadequately sampled, the model might produce skewed predictions. In a company, deploying such a model without evaluating data distribution can lead to unequal healthcare recommendations.

Fairness tools like IBM AI Fairness 360 can detect and mitigate these biases. By auditing the dataset and model outcomes across different subgroups, these tools help identify disparities in prediction accuracy. Techniques such as reweighting, bias mitigation algorithms, and post-processing adjustments can be applied to reduce unfair outcomes, ensuring ethical AI deployment.

Regularly reviewing models in production, maintaining transparent model explainability, and involving diverse teams in development are additional safeguards against bias in AI-powered systems.
