# Task 1: AI-Powered Code Completion — Analysis

## Objective
The goal was to implement a Python function that sorts a list of dictionaries by a specific key. This task was completed manually and then using GitHub Copilot to assist with AI-powered code completion.

## Manual Implementation
The manual version involved defining a function that leverages Python’s built-in `sorted()` function and a lambda expression to sort the list by the desired key. This implementation was straightforward, efficient, and concise.

## AI-Assisted Implementation (GitHub Copilot)
Using GitHub Copilot in VS Code, I began by typing a docstring describing the task. Copilot accurately suggested a complete, functional implementation of the sort function. The AI-suggested code was practically identical to the manual version.

## Efficiency Comparison
Both versions have a time complexity of **O(n log n)**, as they rely on Python’s `sorted()` function. In terms of code readability, both implementations were clear and concise.

## Conclusion
While the AI suggestion was correct and well-formatted, it didn’t surpass human-written efficiency since the problem was relatively simple. However, Copilot proved valuable for reducing time spent on boilerplate code and minimizing the chance of syntactic errors. For more complex or unfamiliar tasks, its assistance would likely offer a greater advantage.
